Hi Dr. Fisher,

This README is supplied by Stephen Daily.

I wanted to try to explain why my testing doesn't work very well...

I had a difficult time testing methods that involved socket connections, and also methods that implemented threads.
Didn't really know what to do, so I just left them blank....

I also wanted to say that I left the chatServer running for when you play with the GUI. 

Everything should connect and work just fine.

Hope you have a great summer. 

-Stephen
