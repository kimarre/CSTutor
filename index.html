   <h3>The CSTutor Project</h3>


   <p>
   <blockquote>
   The cstutor tool provides a form of online manual and help aid for topics covered in computer science classes. Students are able to view outlines of course materials as well as in-depth tutorials created by their instructor. Students can also take quizzes and go back to previous lessons to further reinforce subjects. Instructors are able to check on the progress of each individual student, such as their attempts and scores on quizzes. Instructors are also able to see the overall progress of a class or section.
   </blockquote>

   <p>The cstutor project is organized into the following directories:</p>
   

   <ul>
      <li><a href="requirements">requirements</a> -- user-level functional requirements for the project</li>
      <li><a href="specification">specification</a> -- formal specification of the functional requirements</li>
      <li><a href="prototype">prototype</a> -- operational prototype, with limited functionality

   
      <li><a href="design">design</a> -- architectural software design</li>
      <li><a href="implementation">implementation</a> -- implementation source and executables</li>
      <li><a href="testing">testing</a> -- testing plans and results</li>
      <li><a href="administration">administration</a> -- administrative and managerial information</li>
      <li><a href="documentation">documentation</a> -- audience-specific documentation, such as users manual and installation instructions</li>
   </ul>
   
   <br><p>Details of this organizational structure are given in the online materials for
   Gene Fisher's software engineering courses,
   <a href="http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/308">CSC 308</a> and <a href="http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/~gfisher/classes/309">
