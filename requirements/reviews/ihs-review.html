   <h3>1.5.6. Intelligent Homework System (IHS)</h3>

   <p>"The Intelligent Homework Service (IHS) website provides automated homework problems. Generally, these are randomly-created, conceptual problems testing some area in Computer Science. Although the rules vary per problem, most IHS problems will require students to retry the problem repeatedly until they reach a certain level of ability at the problem." - IHS's Student Manual.</p>

   <h4>Good Features:</h4>
   <ul>
      <li>Alert feature that conducts a countdown until the next assignment is due</li>
      <li>Students must authenticate themselves before being allowed access to the site</li>
      <li>Instructor can create multiple "workbooks" and control student access via names and passcodes for each workbook</li>
      <li>A bar chart on each assignment highlights an individual's score range with respect to the rest of his or her classmates</li>
      <li>Modules and workbooks open out horizontally rather than vertically, reducing the amount of scrolling users have to do</li>
      <li>Semi-interactive console</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Bad Features:</h4>
   <ul>
      <li>Because the code is compiled on a remote server, it is not always reliable </li>
      <li>Students have to navigate to a separate website to view the corresponding lectures and videos</li>
      <li>Students are expected to complete a grossly excessive amount of problems, which does not encourage the sense of accomplishment or learning in students</li>
      <li>The problems are still grouped into subjects rather than sorted by due date, which makes it difficult to distinguish deadlines and time limits</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Missing Features:</h4>
   <ul>
      <li>Immediate instructor feedback or support for students who are struggling with complexity or code that isn't working properly; even minor hints would be a big help</li>
      <li>Overall course progress statistics as well as workbook progress</li>
   </ul>
