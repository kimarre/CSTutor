   <h3>1.5.1. W3Schools</h3>

   <p>W3Schools is an online reference tool for most web development based tools including HTML/CSS, JavaScript/JQuery, SQL, and PHP. It's a great tool for both beginner and advanced programmers alike because the site offers information in a logical order to learn. An organized sidebar of topics allows more advanced users to jump straight to their topics of interest, while beginners may start from the top and work their way down to the more advanced topics.</p>

   <p>W3Schools is perhaps known most for their direct code examples. Throughout the site, code examples reside in text boxes with "Try it yourself" buttons that let you run the code and compare the code to what the end result turns out as.</p>
