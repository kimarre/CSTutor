   <h3>2.8. Student Progress and Assessment</h3>

   <p>This introductory scenario depicts the instructor's view of students' progress through the tutorials. The first image is the first page that appears when an instructor clicks on the Progress button in the menu bar. In the left side bar area, the Overview tab is the default tab selected with two drop-down menus: Tutorials and Classes.</p>

   <p>If a user clicks on either of these menus, they will expand to feature a complete list of the instructor's tutorials or classes, respectively. The instructor can choose to view statistics on a certain tutorial from a list of all tutorials he or she has created, or can view statistics of a certain class to ascertain their grasp of the material.</p>

   <p> Next, when the instructor clicks on the Students tab, a master list of every student enrolled in at least one of his or her tutorials is displayed. Because there is no student selected, the main content section in the middle of the page is empty. </p>

   <p>An instructor can click on an individual student's name to view statistics about his or her progress with the tutorials in the main content window. In the upper half of the frame will be a chart depicting their score on each quiz of the turorials they have completed. Below the chart will be a table listing statistics about each tutorial they are registered for. The table will list the name, quiz score, and percentage of completion of each tutorial.</p>
