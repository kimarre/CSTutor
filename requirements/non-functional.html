   <h3>3. Non-Functional Requirements</h3>

   <p>The non-functional requirements for the CS Tutor Tool are organized into these categories and subcategories:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Performance</li>
      <li>General Characteristics</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Security and Privacy</li>
         <li>Simplicity versus Power</li>
      </ul>
   </ul>

   <h3>3.1. Performance</h3>

   <p>In terms of performance, most features of the CSTutor tool should respond virtually instantaneously. 
       
   </p>


   <h3>3.2. General Characteristics</h3>

   <h4>3.2.1. Security and Privacy</h4>

   <p>In addition to the user passwords being kept secure, the main security concerns with the CS Tutor tool are related to who can access the student statistics. Their quiz scores and progress statistics should only be able to be viewed by the instructor and the students themselves.</p>


   <h4>3.2.2. Simplicity versus Power</h4>

   <p>On the spectrum of simplicity vs. power, our tool leans towards being more simple than anything. Tutorials typically should be easily interacted with. The only things that begin to add complexity would be the progress section.</p>
